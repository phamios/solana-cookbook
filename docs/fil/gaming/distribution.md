# Pamamahagi

Ang pamamahagi ng iyong laro ay lubos na nakadepende sa platform na iyong ginagamit. Sa Solana, may mga game SDK na maaari mong buuin para sa IOS, Android, Web at Native Windows o Mac. Gamit ang Unity SDK maaari mo ring ikonekta ang Nintendo Switch o XBox sa Solana ayon sa teorya. Maraming mga kumpanya ng laro ang umiikot sa isang mobile first approach dahil napakaraming tao ang may mga mobile phone sa mundo. Ang mobile ay may sarili nitong mga komplikasyon, kaya dapat mong piliin kung ano ang pinakaangkop sa iyong laro.

Ang Solana ay may natatanging kalamangan sa iba pang mga blockchain platform dahil sa pag-aalok nito ng isang crypto-native na mobile phone, na pinangalanang Saga, na nilagyan ng isang makabagong dApps store. Ang tindahang ito ay nagbibigay-daan sa pamamahagi ng mga larong crypto nang walang mga limitasyong ipinataw ng mga kumbensyonal na tindahan ng app gaya ng Google o Apple.

## Mga Platform sa Pag-publish

Mga platform kung saan maaari mong i-host ang iyong mga laro

| Platform | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [Fractal](https://www.fractal.is/) | A game publishing platform that supports Solana and Ethereum. They also have their own wallet and account handling and there is an SDK for high scores and tournaments.  |
| [Elixir](https://elixir.app/) | Platform for web3 games that also offers a PC launcher |
| Self Hosting | Just host your game yourself. For example using [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) which can be easily setup so that a new version get deployed as soon as you push to your repository. Other options are [github pages](https://pages.github.com/) or [Google Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/docs/hosting) |
| [Solana mobile DApp Store](https://github.com/solana-mobile/dapp-publishing/blob/main/README.md) | The Solana alternative to Google Play and the Apple App Store. A crypto first variant of a dApp store, which is open source free for everyone to use. |
| [Apple App Store](https://www.apple.com/de/app-store/) | The Apple app store has a high reach and is trusted by its customers. The entrance barrier for crypto games is high though. The rules are very strict for everything that tries to circumvent the fees that Apple takes for in app purchases. A soon as an NFT provides benefits for the player for example Apple requires you for example to have them purchased via their in app purchase system.  |
| [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/games) | Google is much more crypto friendly and games with NFTs and wallet deep links for example have had a track record of being approved for the official play store.  |
| [xNFT Backpack](https://www.backpack.app/) | Backpack is a Solana wallet which allows you to release apps as xNFTs. They appear in the users wallet as soon as they purchase them as applications. The Unity SDK has a xNFT export and any other web app can be published as xNFT as well. |
