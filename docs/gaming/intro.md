# Intro into gaming on Solana

The gaming space in the Solana ecosystem is expanding rapidly. Integrating with Solana can provide numerous benefits for games, such as enabling players to own and trade their assets via NFTs in games, building a real in-game economy, creating composable game programs, and allowing players to compete for valuable assets.

Solana is purpose-built for games, with its 400ms block time and lightning-fast confirmations making it a real-time database that's free for all. It's perfect for genres like strategy games, city builders, turn-based games, and more.

However, not everything needs to be put on the blockchain. Smaller integrations using NFTs that represent game items, for example, can be easily done. Transaction fees are extremely cheap, and there are many tools and SDKs available to start building today. You can build your game in [Javascript](https://docs.solana.com/de/developing/clients/javascript-api) and Canvas, [Flutter](https://github.com/espresso-cash/espresso-cash-public), or use one of the Solana Game SDKs for the two biggest game engines - [UnitySDK](./game-sdks), [UnrealSDK](https://github.com/staratlasmeta/FoundationKit), and more [Game SDKs](./game-sdks).

There are several ways to integrate Solana into your game:

1. Give players digital collectibles for in-game items or use them as characters. Check out [Nfts in games](./nfts-in-games)
2. Use tokens for in-app purchases or micro-payments in the game. See [use tokens](./interact-with-tokens)
3. Use the player's wallet to authenticate them in the game. [Sign message](../references/keypairs-and-wallets.html#how-to-sign-and-verify-messages-with-wallets) 
4. Run tournaments and pay out crypto rewards to your players. 
5. Develop the game entirely on-chain to reward your players in every step they take. Start with [Hello world](./hello-world)

With all these benefits, Solana is quickly becoming the go-to platform for game developers. Get started today!
