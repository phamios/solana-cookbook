# Cooking with Solana

The *Solana Cookbook* is a developer resource that 
provides the essential concepts and references for 
building applications on Solana. Each concept and 
reference will focus on specific aspects of Solana 
development while providing additional details and usage 
examples.

## Contributing

The Cookbook is designed in a way that makes it easy for 
new Solana developers to contribute. Even if you 
don't know how to do something, contributing to the 
cookbook is a great way to learn!

Check out all open issues [here](https://github.com/solana-developers/solana-cookbook/issues). Contribution guidelines [here](https://github.com/solana-developers/solana-cookbook#contributing). If you find the cookbook is missing a suggestion, please add an issue.
