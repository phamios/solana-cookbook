With PDAs, programs can sign for accounts while guaranteeing that no external user could also generate a valid signature for the same account. In addition to signing for accounts, certain programs can also modify accounts held at their PDAs.</p><p><img src="'+p+'" alt="Accounts matrix"></p><p><small style="text-align:center;display:block;">Image courtesy of <a href="https://twitter.com/pencilflip">Pencilflip</a></small></p><h3 id="generating-pdas" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#generating-pdas" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Generating PDAs</h3><p>To understand the concept behind PDAs, it may be helpful to consider that PDAs are not technically created, but rather found. PDAs are generated from a combination of seeds (such as the string <code>\u201Cvote_account\u201D</code>) and a program id. This combination of seeds and program id is then run through a sha256 hash function to see whether or not they generate a public key that lies on the ed25519 elliptic curve.</p><p>In running our program id and seeds through a hash function, there is a ~50% chance that we actually end up with a valid public key that does lie on the elliptic curve. In this case, we simply add something to fudge our input a little bit and try again. The technical term for this fudge factor is a bump. In Solana, we start with bump = 255 and simply iterate down through bump = 254, bump = 253, etc. until we get an address that is not on the elliptic curve. This may seem rudimentary, but once found it gives us a deterministic way of deriving the same PDA over and over again.</p><p><img src="'+u+'" alt="PDA on the ellipitic curve"></p><h3 id="interacting-with-pdas" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#interacting-with-pdas" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Interacting with PDAs</h3>',9),V=t("When a PDA is generated, "),W=e("code",null,"findProgramAddress",-1),B=t(" will return both the address and the bump used to kick the address off of the elliptic curve.
